<h1>vim-wiki</h1>
A simple vim-plugin for searching-for and browsing-between wikipedia entries using vim.

<h1>Why?</h1>
I love vim and I often find it hard to swap between vim and the browser (particularly when I am making notes) because the visual-formatting between the two environments are so inconsistent (as well as the fact that I don't use vim-keybindings in my browser). This plugin allows you to view and jump-between wikipedia entries in a vim-buffer.

<h1>Hasn't this been done before?</h1>
Probably - I have been making a few different vim-plugins lately and I thought this would make a good exercise. If you find a better alternative I fully encourage you to use it.
